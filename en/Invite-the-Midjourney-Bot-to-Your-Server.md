#### Invite the Midjourney Bot to any Discord Server to create with friends, or make a personal Discord Server to organize your work.

Once the Midjourney Bot has joined your server, you can begin interacting with it using the `/imagine` command.

### Notes

Midjourney images generated on private servers are still subject to Midjourney's [Community Guidelines](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/community-guidelines).

Images generated on private servers are still visible to other users on [midjourney.com](https://midjourney.com/).

To use the Midjourney Bot in any server, users must have an active Midjourney trial or subscription. Using `/imagine` for the first time will automatically begin a trial membership for new users.

## Bot Management

### Restrict the Bot to Specific Channels

If you do not want the Midjourney Bot to be usable in specific channels, go to **Edit Channel**, select the **Permissions** tab, select **@everyone** under **Roles/Members** and **_Uncheck_ "Use Application Commands."**  
Users who try to use the Midjourney Bot in a channel with these permissions disabled will not see the command.

For more granular control, go to **Settings**, select **Integrations**, the **Permissions** tab, the **\+ for the Midjourney Bot**, and **Manage Integration.**  
`slash command` permissions can then be set for individual roles and channels.
