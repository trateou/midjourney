#### Midjourney is an open-by-default community, and all image generations are visible at midjourney.com, including images created in private discord servers, direct messages, and on the Midjourney web app.

Subscribers to the Pro Plan have access to Stealth Mode to prevent their images from being visible to others on the Midjourney website. The `/stealth` and `/public` commands toggle between Stealth and Public mode.

**Stealth Mode Only Prevents Others From Viewing Your Images on Midjourney.com!**  
Images generated in public channels are always visible to other users, even while using Stealth Mode. To prevent others from seeing an image you create using Stealth Mode, generate images in your Direct Messages or on a private Discord server.
