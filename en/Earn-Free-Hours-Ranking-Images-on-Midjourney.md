## How to Rate Images

Click a smiley button to rate any upscaled image on the Midjourney website or in Discord. Each day, the top 1000 image raters receive an hour of free, Fast Mode time. Rank your work or the work of others. Highly rated images may appear in the trending section of the community feed. If you are one of the top raters for the day, you will receive a direct message from the Midjourney Bot when you are awarded hours.
