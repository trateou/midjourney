#### The `--quality` or `--q` parameter changes how much time is spent generating an image. Higher-quality settings take longer to process and produce more details. Higher values also mean more GPU minutes are used per job. The quality setting does not impact resolution.

The default `--quality` value is 1. Higher values use more of your subscription's GPU minutes.  
`--quality` accepts the values: .25, .5, and 1 for the default model. Larger values will be rounded down to 1.  
`--quality` only influences the initial image generation.  
`--quality` works with [Model Versions](https://docs.midjourney.com/models) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and niji.

## Quality Settings

Higher `--quality` settings aren't always better. Sometimes a lower `--quality` settings can produce better resultsâ€”depending on the image you're trying to create. Lower `--quality` settings might be best for a gestural abstract look. Higher `--quality` values may improve the look of architectural images that benefit from many details. Choose the setting that best matches the kind of image you're hoping to create.

Prompt example: `/imagine prompt` `woodcut birch forest --q .25`

The Midjourney Bot processes jobs on high-end GPUs. Each minute that it takes to complete a job is a **GPU minute**. You have a limited amount of GPU minutes when in **Fast Mode**. Because image generations may be processed on multiple GPUs simultaneously, GPU minutes are not directly connected to the time you wait for an image to generate.
