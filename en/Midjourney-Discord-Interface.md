### Upscale Buttons

`U1` `U2` `U3` `U4` U buttons [upscale](https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/upscalers) an image generating a larger version of the selected image and adding more details.

### Redo

`üîÑ` The redo (re-roll) button reruns a job. In this case, it would rerun the original prompt producing a new grid of images.

### Variation Buttons

`V1` `V2` `V3` `V4` V buttons create incremental variations of the selected grid image. Creating a variation generates a new image grid similar to the chosen image's overall style and composition.
