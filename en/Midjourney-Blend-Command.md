#### The `/blend` command allows you to upload 2â€“5 images quickly and then looks at the concepts and aesthetics of each image and merges them into a novel new image.

`/blend` is the same as using multiple [image prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/image-prompts) with `/imagine`, but the interface is optimized for easy use on mobile devices.  
`/blend` works with up to 5 images. To use more than 5 images in a prompt use [image prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/image-prompts) with `/imagine`  
`/blend` does not work with text prompts. To use text and image prompts together, use [image prompts](https://docs.midjourney.com/image-prompts) and text with `/imagine`

## `/blend` Options

After typing the `/blend` command, you will be prompted to upload two photos. Drag and drop images from your hard drive or add images from your photo library when using a mobile device. To add more images, select the `optional/options` field and select `image3`, `image4`, or `image5`. The `/blend` command may take longer to start than other commands because your images must be uploaded before the Midjourney Bot can process your request.

Blended images have a default [1:1 aspect ratio](https://docs.midjourney.com/v1/docs/aspect-ratios), but you can use the optional `dimensions` field to select between a square aspect ratio (1:1), portrait aspect ration (2:3), or landscape aspect ratio (3:2).

[Custom suffixes](https://docs.midjourney.com/v1/docs/settings-and-presets) are added to the end of `/blend` prompts, like any other `/imagine` prompt. Aspect ratios specified as part of the `/blend` command override aspect ratios within a custom suffix.

Blending Tip

For the best results, upload images that are the same aspect ratio as your desired result.
