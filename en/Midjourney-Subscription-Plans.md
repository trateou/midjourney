### Monthly Renewal

-   Unused monthly Fast GPU time does not roll over.
-   Fast mode is automatically reactivated when the subscription renews.

### Switch Plans

Upgrade or downgrade plans at any time. When upgrading, you may choose whether the upgrade should be effective immediately, or at the end of the current billing cycle. If you choose to upgrade immediately, you will be offered a prorated price based on the usage of the plan you are upgrading from. Downgrades are always effective at the end of the current billing cycle.

Proration?

Unused Fast GPU Time is credited towards your account when you choose to upgrade immediately. If a Basic subscriber upgrades immediately without using any GPU time, they receive a $10 credit towards their new plan. If a Standard subscriber upgrades after using 50% of their Fast GPU time, they recieve a $15 credit towards their new plan.

### Cancellation

## Buy More Fast Hours

Run out of Fast GPU and want to buy more before your monthly subscription renews? You can purchase additional Fast GPU hours for $4/hr. This cost is billed incrementally and charged at the end of the month or when you hit a billing threshold (the monthly price of your base plan). Hourly Prices are experimental and subject to change.

Purchase more Fast GPU hours on your [Midjourney account page.](http://www.midjourney.com/account)

Purchased Fast GPU hours do not expire, but you must have an active subscription to use them.

## Account Information

Use the `/info` command to view information about your account, including how much Fast time is left for the subscription period, lifetime usage stats, the number of queued or running jobs, and the subscription renewal date.

![User Information Panel](https://cdn.document360.io/3040c2b6-fead-4744-a3a9-d56d621c6c7e/Images/Documentation/MJ_Command_Info_Result.png)

There are two modes for image generation, **Fast Mode** and **Relax Mode**. Fast Mode tries to give you a GPU instantly. It's the highest-priority processing tier and uses your subscription's monthly GPU time. **Relax Mode** queues your generation behind others based on how much you've used the system. **Relax Mode** wait times are variable and usually range from 1–10 minutes.

By default, images are generated using **Fast Mode**. You can switch to **Relax** if you have a Standard or Pro subscription.
