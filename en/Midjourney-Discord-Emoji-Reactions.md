## ❌ Cancel and Delete

❌ Cancels or deletes a Job at any time. Reacting to a job with an X emoji also removes the Job from the Midjourney website. If you want to delete an image from the Midjourney webpage but can't find the image within Discord, use the [`/show` command](https://docs.midjourney.com/show-job) to revive the Job.

## ✉️ Send to Direct Messages

React with the envelope emoji ✉️ to send a completed Job to direct messages. The direct message will include the image's seed number and Job ID. If the envelope emoji is used for an image grid the grid will be sent as individual images. The ✉️ reaction only works with your own Jobs.

Job IDs are unique identifiers used for each image generated by Midjourney.  
Job IDs look like this: 9333dcd0-681e-4840-a29c-801e502ae424and can be found in the first part of all image filenames, in the URLs on the website, and in an image's filename.
