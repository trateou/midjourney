#### Use Remix Mode to change prompts, parameters, model versions, or aspect ratios between variations. Remix will take the general composition of your starting image and use it as part of the new Job. Remixing can help change the setting or lighting of an image, evolve a subject, or achieve tricky compositions.

`Remix` is an experimental feature that may change or be removed at any time.

## Using Remix

Activate Remix mode with the `/prefer remix` command or by using the `/settings` command and toggling the `üéõÔ∏è Remix Mode` button. Remix changes the behavior of the variation buttons (V1, V2, V3, V4) under image grids. When Remix is enabled, it allows you to edit your prompt during each variation. To Remix an upscale select `ü™Ñ Make Variations`.

When `Remix` is enabled, Variation buttons turn green when used instead of blue.  
You can switch [Model Versions](https://docs.midjourney.com/models) when using Remix.  
When you are done with Remix use the `/settings` or `/prefer remix` command to turn it off.  
Create a standard image variation when Remix is active by not modifying the prompt in the pop-up window.

### Step 1

**Turn on Remix mode.**

Select an image grid or upscaled image to Remix.

### Step 2

`Remix`

**Select "Make Variations."**

Modify or enter a new prompt in the pop-up.

The Midjourney Bot generates an image using the new prompt with influence from the original image.

### Using Parameters with Remix

You can add or remove [Parameters](https://docs.midjourney.com/parameter-list) while using Remix mode, but you must use valid parameter combinations. Changing `/imagine prompt` `illustrated stack of pumpkins --version 3 --stylize 10000` to `illustrated stack of pumpkins --version 4 --stylize 10000` will return an error because Midjourney Model Version 4 is incompatible with the Stylize parameter.

Only parameters that normally influence variations will work while using Remix:

|  | Affects Initial  
Generation | Affects Variations  
and Remix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Aspect Ratio\* | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Chaos | ‚úì |  |
| Image Weight | ‚úì |  |
| No | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Quality | ‚úì |  |
| Seed | ‚úì |  |
| Same Seed | ‚úì |  |
| Stop | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Stylize | ‚úì |  |
| Tile | ‚úì | ‚úì |
| Video | ‚úì | ‚úì |

-   Changing aspect ratios with Remix will _stretch_ an image. It will not extend the canvas, add missing details, or fix a bad crop.
